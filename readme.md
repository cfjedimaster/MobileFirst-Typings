Typings for MobileFirst
===

This repository contains a [DefinityTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/) definition file for developers working with hybrid mobile apps and the [IBM MobileFirst](http://www.ibm.com/mobilefirst/us/en/) platform. To use, simply copy the file that matches your version of MobileFirst to your project. I've tested this with VisualStudio Code but it should work in multiple editors.

Currently I have *not* added all of the JavaScript api to the library. I've covered:

* Analytics
* App
* Badge
* BusyIndicator
* Toast
